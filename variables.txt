food = "apples"
is_delicious = true
food = "steak"
num_2 = 4
num_7 = 13
quotient = num_7 / num_2
songs = ["song 1", "song 2", "song 3", "song 4"]
songs.shift
puts "How many characters are there in the food string?"

Also, not sure I understood the question but if you wanted us to write a line of code
that found the length of the string it would be: "steak".length
